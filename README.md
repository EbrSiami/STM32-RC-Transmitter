## Due to ongoing wartime conditions, I was unable to conduct field flights for a long period, which left version 4.0.1 in a prolonged beta state. Today, after months of waiting, I decided to just say "screw it all" and went out to the flight field. 

## Fortunately, the new firmware version—featuring newly implemented capabilities such as Exponential (Expo), Dual Rates, and more—performed flawlessly. I am proud to announce that this release is officially out of beta and ready for stable use. 

## Flight logs and further development details will be posted soon. Happy flying!

## 🎮 Transmitter

8-channel RC transmitter firmware for the STM32F103.
Runs a **500 Hz control loop** with a full OLED menu system — no PC required for configuration.

### Features

**Control & Input**
- 8 channels: 4 analog gimbals + 2 analog pots + 2 digital switches
- Digital trims for Roll, Pitch, and Yaw — saved to EEPROM with center-snap and end limits
- Selectable throttle mode: Airplane (lower-half zero) or Normal

**Signal Processing**
- EMA noise filter on all 6 analog inputs
- Step-by-step stick calibration wizard (center, min, max)
- Configurable deadband, Expo (−100 % to +100 %), Dual Rate (10–100 %)
- Sub-Trim and EPA (End-Point Adjustment) for the 3 main channels
- Per-channel inversion (all 8 channels)
- 5 mixer presets: Normal, V-Tail A/B, Delta A/B

**OLED UI (0.96")**
- Real-time dashboard: battery voltage, flight timer, D/R status, TX link indicator
- Live channel bar views (CH1–4 and CH5–8)
- Flight timer: countdown or stopwatch, armed by throttle, with buzzer alerts at 1 min / 30 s / last 10 s
- Full menu system: Expo, Dual Rate, Channel Invert, Mixer, Calibration, EPA/Sub-Trim, Simulator Mode
- Animated splash screen at boot

**Reliability**
- Non-blocking architecture — zero `delay()` in the main loop
- NRF24L01+ at 250 kbps, max power, auto-ACK off — 500 Hz update rate
- Priority buzzer engine (14 patterns) — high-priority alarms override all settings
- EEPROM with magic number + CRC; auto-reset to safe defaults on corruption
- 2S/3S LiPo battery monitor with low-voltage SOS alarm

### ⚠️ Flash Size — Important

The compiled firmware is approximately **70 KB**. The standard STM32F103C**8**T6
(Blue Pill, 64 KB Flash) is **not supported**. Use one of the following:

- STM32F103C**B**T6 (128 KB Flash) — recommended
- STM32F103 Chinese clones with 128–256 KB Flash (common, usually works)
- STM32 Black Pill (with pinout adjustments)

### Pinout

| Component | STM32 Pin | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NRF24L01+** | | |
| CE | `PB8` | |
| CSN | `PB9` | |
| SCK / MISO / MOSI | `PA5 / PA6 / PA7` | SPI1 |
| **OLED Display** | | |
| SDA / SCL | `PB7 / PB6` | I2C1 |
| **Gimbals** | `PA0 – PA3` | ADC |
| **Aux Pots** | `PB0, PB1` | ADC |
| **Aux Switches** | `PB4, PB5` | Digital input |
| **Trim Buttons** | `PB15, PA8–PA10, PA15, PB3` | Active low |
| **Nav Buttons** | `PB12 – PB14` | Up / Down / Enter |
| **Buzzer** | `PC13` | Active high |
| **Battery Sense** | `PA4` | Voltage divider |

### Hardware Notes

**NRF24L01+ power supply**
The module is sensitive to power noise. Solder a 10–100 µF capacitor directly across its
VCC and GND pins. A dedicated AMS1117-3.3 regulator is preferred over the Blue Pill's
onboard 3.3 V rail, which may not supply enough peak current.

**I2C pull-ups**
The STM32 internal pull-ups are too weak for I2C. Add external 4.7 kΩ resistors on
both SDA and SCL.

**Buzzer driver**
Do not connect the buzzer directly to a GPIO pin. Use an NPN transistor (e.g. 2N2222)
or a small MOSFET as a driver circuit.

**Battery voltage divider**
R1 = 22 kΩ (to Battery+), R2 = 6.8 kΩ (to GND). Maximum measurable voltage: ~14 V (3S safe).

### Build & Flash

**Prerequisites:** VS Code with PlatformIO extension, ST-Link V2 programmer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EbrSiami/OpenRC-STM32.git
```

Open the `transmitter/` folder in PlatformIO, build with **✓**, and upload with **→**.

Alternatively, flash the pre-built `.elf` from the Releases page using STM32CubeProgrammer
(preferred over `.bin` for automatic address handling).

<a name="receiver"></a>
## 📡 Receiver

Compact 8-channel receiver firmware. Decodes NRF24L01+ packets from the transmitter
and outputs both individual **PWM signals** and a hardware-timed **PPM stream** simultaneously.
Includes a 500 ms failsafe that cuts throttle on link loss.

**Compile with `-Os`** (optimize for size) — the G030F6P6 has 32 KB Flash and 8 KB RAM.

### LED Status

| Pattern | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| Solid ON | Link active — packets being received |
| Slow blink (500 ms) | Waiting for signal |
| Fast blink (100 ms) | NRF24L01+ hardware fault |

### Failsafe Values

On link loss (> 500 ms), all channels are set to safe defaults:
Roll / Pitch / Yaw → 1500 µs (neutral), Throttle → 900 µs (motors off),
all Aux channels → 1000 µs.

### Pinout

| Component | STM32 Pin | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NRF24L01+** | | |
| CE | `PA4` | |
| CSN | `PA5` | |
| SCK / MISO / MOSI | `PA1 / PA6 / PA2` | SPI |
| **PWM Outputs** | | |
| CH1 Roll | `PA0` | |
| CH2 Pitch | `PA3` | |
| CH3 Throttle | `PA7` | |
| CH4 Yaw | `PB0` | |
| CH5 Aux1 | `PA11` | |
| CH6 Aux2 | `PA12` | |
| CH7 Aux3 | `PB3` | |
| CH8 Aux4 | `PB7` | |
| **PPM Output** | `PC14` | Hardware timer TIM3 |
| **Status LED** | `PC15` | |

### Hardware Notes

**NRF24L01+ power supply**
Same as transmitter — add a 10–100 µF capacitor directly across the module's VCC and GND.

**RST and BOOT0 pins**
These must not be left floating. Pull BOOT0 to GND (normal run mode).
RST should have a pull-up resistor to VCC (typically 10 kΩ).

**No external crystal needed**
The G030F6P6 uses its internal RC oscillator. No external crystal is required.

**PWM / PPM signal lines**
Add a ~1 kΩ series resistor on each PWM and PPM output pin to protect the MCU
and reduce ringing on long cables.

### Build & Flash

Open the `receiver/receiver.ino` file in Arduino IDE. Set `build_flags to -Os` in Menu.

Or Flash using ST-Link V2 with STM32CubeProgrammer (use the `.elf` from Releases).

<a name="simulator"></a>
## 🖥️ Simulator (RC Ground Station)

A Windows desktop application that bridges the transmitter's **Simulator Mode**
to any FPV simulator via a **vJoy virtual joystick**.

### How it works

The transmitter's Simulator Mode disables the NRF24L01+ radio and instead sends
channel data over the STM32's built-in USB CDC (Virtual COM Port).

> **Note:** This uses a custom serial protocol — not iBUS or SBUS.
> Standard iBUS timing was not reliable over STM32 USB CDC (which behaves differently
> from dedicated USB-UART chips like CH340), so a purpose-built protocol was developed
> for full control over framing and error detection. The protocol includes a
> **CRC-8 checksum** on every packet.

Simulator Mode is **never saved to EEPROM** — the transmitter always boots with the
radio active. This is intentional for safety.

### Activation — step by step

1. Power on the transmitter (radio is active by default).
2. Navigate to **Features** in the OLED menu.
3. Select **Simulator Mode** (last item, default: `Off`) and turn it `On`.
4. The NRF24L01+ shuts down automatically and the transmitter switches to USB data output.
5. Connect the transmitter to your PC via USB.
6. Open **RC Ground Station**, select the correct COM port (STM32 CDC ports are marked ✓),
   and click **Connect Device**.
7. Channel bars will update in real time. The transmitter is now a joystick.

**Before connecting:** install vJoy and the STM32 Virtual COM Port driver.
Both are included in the Ground Station installer, or can be opened via
the **⚡ Install Required Drivers** button inside the app.

### Channel Mapping

| RC Channel | vJoy Axis | Range |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CH1 Roll | X | 0–32767 |
| CH2 Pitch | Y | 0–32767 |
| CH3 Throttle | Z | 0–32767 |
| CH4 Yaw | Rx | 0–32767 |
| CH5 AUX1 | Ry | 0–32767 |
| CH6 AUX2 | Rz | 0–32767 |
| CH7 AUX3 | Button 1 | 0 / 1 |
| CH8 AUX4 | Button 2 | 0 / 1 |

### Running from source

```bash
pip install customtkinter pyserial pyvjoy
python simulator/simulator.py
```

The pre-built `.exe` (with bundled drivers) is available on the [Releases page](../../releases).
